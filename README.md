# Slides Synch
Simple Web application for sharing and synchronizing slides presentation.

This project is experimental! 

More description to come!

Check the [demo](http://slidesynch.bachwehbi.net:8080)
## How it works
* Upload a file (your presentation deck)
* Share the presentation link
* Navigate through your file, all viewers will be synchronized while you change pages and with your moue pointer. 

## Difference with screen sharing
Screen sharing is awesome, I use it very regularly. However there are situations where screen sharing will not work like:

* Limited network bandwidth (screen sharing is video streaming)
* Feature missing on some operating systems (SKYPE on Linux)

## TODO
* Full screen support on IE & Firefox
* Add Zoom-In & Zoom-Out
* Add responsive Navigation bar
* Integrate Chat (for questions for example)
